## User Guide

### For Residents

#### Home Page

On the home page, you can find an overview of the Barangay Katipunan, highlighting key aspects and updates. This serves as a starting point for exploring other sections of the system.

#### About Us

In the "About Us" section, you will find the Barangay Katipunan's mission and vision statements, providing insight into our goals and aspirations. Additionally, this section includes information about our facilities, giving you an overview of the resources available to residents and visitors.

#### Services

The "Services" section is designed to help you access various certifications and clearances. To request documents such as certificates of indigency or barangay clearances, you need to log in to your account. If you are a new user, you can sign up as a resident. Please note that all new accounts require approval from the admin before you can access the services.

#### Login Page

The login page allows both users and admins to access their accounts. If you are a resident and do not yet have an account, you can sign up. Once you submit your registration, you will need to wait for the admin's approval before you can log in and use the services.

#### Language Toggle

To cater to a diverse community, we have included a language toggle button that allows you to switch between Tagalog and English. This feature ensures that the information is accessible to everyone, regardless of their preferred language.

#### Contacts

In the "Contacts" section, residents and non-residents can view the barangay location through an interactive map. This feature helps you easily find and navigate to our barangay. Additionally, there is a contact form provided for you to ask questions or make inquiries directly to the barangay.

### For Administrators

#### Admin Dashboard

Whenever an admin logs in, the first thing they'll see is the dashboard. This dashboard includes four types of charts: two bar graphs, one line graph, and one pie chart. The first bar graph provides an overview of the population difference between males and females. The line graph shows the number of registered residents per year. The second bar graph displays the highest educational attainment of residents. Finally, the pie chart provides an overview of the age distribution of residents in the barangay.

#### Barangay Officials Page

The "Barangay Officials" page allows an admin to view the list of barangay officials and print the list. Additionally, the admin can add, archive, and edit the table containing information about these officials.

#### Residents Page

The "Residents" page enables an admin to view the list of residents and print the list. The admin can also add, archive, and edit the table containing information about the residents.

#### Contact Us Page

The "Contact Us" page allows an admin to view the inquiries of residents submitted through the contact form. This page helps the admin manage and respond to questions or concerns raised by the community either through Gmail or phone number provided by residents.

#### User Approval

Under the "Reports" section, admins can manage user account requests. Here, admins can view, approve, or decline requests regarding account registrations. This feature ensures that all user accounts are properly vetted and managed within the system.

#### Audit Trail

The "Audit Trail" feature serves as an activity log where admins can track actions performed by previous admins. It records details such as who deleted specific items or performed other significant actions. This helps maintain accountability and transparency within the barangay information system.

#### Certification Request

In the "Certification Request" section, admins can manage requests for three types of certificates: barangay clearance, indigency, and other certificates. Admins have the authority to approve or decline these requests. Upon approval, admins can generate the requested certificate, ensuring efficient processing and delivery of services to residents.

#### Contact Information Setting

Under the "Contact Information Setting," admins can update the contact details of the barangay. This functionality allows admins to make changes to contact information without requiring developer assistance, facilitating prompt updates and accurate communication with residents and stakeholders.

#### Add Facilities Setting

In the "Add Facilities Setting," admins can upload pictures and provide titles for various barangay facilities. These updates will be reflected on the front page of the system, where both residents and non-residents can view information about these facilities. This feature enhances transparency and accessibility, enabling the community to stay informed about the amenities available within the barangay.

#### Backup Setting

Backup Setting is where an admin can download the backup of the data within their system. It's provided with the date and SQL type of file.
